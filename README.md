# Whats the code about

Toy program for animal identification that has appeared in several references in some form or another. 
We take the opportunity to give a unique formulation using Prolog clauses as the rule database. 
The implementation of verification of askable goals (questions) is especially clean. This example is a good 
motivation for expert systems, which are studied in Chapter 6 of Winston and Horn (1985).

The program uses its identification rules to determine the animal that you have chosen.
